# Clinical Risk Prediction Using Interpretable Machine Learning

## Objective
To develop an interpretable machine learning model for identifying high-risk patients using routine clinical laboratory data, with emphasis on patient safety and early screening.

## Dataset
A simulated clinical dataset containing patient demographics and laboratory values such as hemoglobin and cholesterol.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and clinically safe missing value handling
- Exploratory data analysis and threshold validation
- Feature engineering using clinical domain knowledge
- Logistic regression modeling with class-weighted loss
- Model evaluation prioritizing recall (sensitivity) and stability

## Outcome
The model supports early risk identification while maintaining clinical interpretability and reliability.
